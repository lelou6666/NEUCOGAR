About BG: http://brainmind.com/BasalGanglia.html

Structure
BG are strongly interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, as well as several other brain areas.
1.1 Striatum
    96 % Medium spiny neurons - GABA-ergic cells
    2 % cholinergic interneurons
    Here, we show that dopamine neurons make direct fast dopaminergic and glutamatergic connections with cholinergic interneurons, with regional heterogeneity.
        tonic active neurons ?
    The largest component, the striatum, receives input from many brain areas beyond the basal ganglia, but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia.
    striatum and globus pallidus may be considered anatomically distinct from the substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and subthalamic nucleus.
    The ventral striatum is a portion of the striatum. It consists of the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle,[1] and islands of Calleja.
1.2 Pallidum (Globus Palidus)
    -GPi
    -GPe -> STN
1.3 Substantia nigra
    -SNr (union with GPi: SNr-GPi complex)
    -SNc (modulates striatal pathways)
1.4 Subthalamic nucleus (STN) only it is excitory
1.5 Circuit connections

not mentioned:
1.6 Striatum consist of Caudate nucleus, Putamen and nucleus accumbens

EPSC - Excitatory postsynaptic potential
